I'm Naveen Jagadeesan, known online as [TheVillageHacker](https://x.com/thevillagehackr). I'm a passionate Security Analyst, CRTP-certified Red Teamer, and cybersecurity researcher with over 6+ years of experience in application and network security.

My journey into hacking began with a curiosity for how things breakâ€”and more importantly, how to secure them. From humble beginnings as an IoT developer, Iâ€™ve worked my way through pentesting roles at leading security firms and financial institutions, performing over 300+ penetration tests and 50+ secure code reviews across Web, API, Mobile, and Thick Client platforms.

My professional experience spans across organizations like Societe Generale and SISA Information Security, where Iâ€™ve led critical security assessments, mentored junior analysts, and developed automation tools to improve security testing efficiency.

When Iâ€™m not breaking into applications (ethically, of course), I contribute to the community by reporting vulnerabilities, mentoring aspiring hackers, and sharing practical insights from the field. You can often find me tinkering with scripts, publishing writeups, and building tools to make hacking more efficient and impactful.

Whether it's red teaming, code auditing, or network pentesting, Iâ€™m always up for a challengeâ€”and always hacking to learn.
